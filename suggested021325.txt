Okay, I understand.  If you've confirmed that the information you've provided is an accurate representation of your MLOps conda environment, then we can proceed with that as our baseline.  Knowing exactly what's installed is crucial for any further steps or troubleshooting.

To make sure we're on the same page, please confirm if this is an accurate summary of what you have (or intend to have) in your `mlo-env` conda environment:

*   **Core Tools:**
    *   MLflow
    *   DVC (if needed for data versioning)
    *   Pandas
    *   NumPy
    *   Scikit-learn
    *   PyTorch (or TensorFlow)
    *   Matplotlib
    *   Seaborn
    *   Altair (via `altair-all`)
--------------------------------------------------
*   `xarray` (if needed for multi-dimensional arrays)
*   `scipy` (if needed for scientific computing)
*   `apache-spark` and `pyspark` (if needed for distributed computing)
*   `petl` or `dask` (or other ETL libraries as needed)
*   `selenium` (if needed for browser automation)



    ---------------------------------------------
    
    
    *   `statsmodels` (if needed for statistical modeling)
    *   `missingno` (if needed for visualizing missing data)
    *   `imbalanced-learn` (if needed for imbalanced datasets)
    *   `jupyter` (for Jupyter notebooks)
    *   `requests` (if needed for HTTP requests)
    *   `beautifulsoup4` (if needed for web scraping)
    
    *   `tqdm` (for progress bars)
    *   `pyarrow` (if needed for efficient data structures)
    *   `fastparquet` (if needed for Parquet files)
    *   
    *   `xgboost` (if needed)
    *   `lightgbm` (if needed)
    *   `catboost` (if needed)

*   **Docker:** Installed *separately* at the system level (not within the conda environment).

*   **Web Frameworks:**  You're deferring the decision on web frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, DRF) until a specific project requires them.

If this is an accurate reflection of your environment, then we're ready to move on to the next step, which would be to discuss your specific goals or tasks within this environment.  Knowing what you want to achieve will help determine the best way to use these tools together.
